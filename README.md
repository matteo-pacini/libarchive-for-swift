# üì¶ libarchive for Swift

A Swift Package Manager distribution of [libarchive](https://libarchive.org/) for Apple platforms.

![Supported Platforms](https://img.shields.io/badge/platforms-iOS%2016%20%7C%20macOS%2013%20%7C%20watchOS%209%20%7C%20tvOS%2016-lightgrey)

## üåü Features

- **Platform Support**: This package provides libarchive for a wide range of Apple devices:
  - **macOS**: >= 13.0 (`arm64` and `x86_64`)
  - **iOS**: >= 16 (`arm64`, `arm64e` for device - `arm64` and `x86_64` for simulator)
  - **watchOS**: >= 9.0 (`arm64` and `arm64_32` for device - `arm64` and `x86_64` for simulator)
  - **tvOS**: >= 16.0 (`arm64` for device | `arm64` and `x86_64` for simulator)

- **üõ† Comprehensive Integration**: `libarchive` is packaged as a static XCFramework, meaning it incorporates all necessary symbols for both the primary library and its dependencies.

- **üîÑ Rebuilt Dependencies**: The included `libarchive` rebuilds `bzip2`, `libz4`, `xz`, `zlib` and `zstd` from scratch, to avoid linking against SDK libraries that may be considered private by Apple. This package requires a minimal set of system libraries to function: `iconv`, `xml2`, and `pthread`.

## üìö Included Libraries

## üîß Installation

### Swift Package Manager (SPM)

You can use Swift Package Manager to add libarchive to your project:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/matteo-pacini/libarchive-for-swift.git", exact: "1.0.0")
]
```

Then, add the dependency to your target:

```swift
.target(
    name: "YourTarget",
    dependencies: [
        .product(name: "libarchive", package: "libarchive-for-swift")
    ]
)
```

## üí° Usage

This package provides direct access to the C API of libarchive. You'll need to use the C API directly in your Swift code.

### Importing in Swift

```swift
import libarchive
```

### C API Examples

For examples of how to use the libarchive C API, please refer to the official [libarchive examples](https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive/wiki/Examples).

These examples demonstrate common operations such as:
- Creating archives
- Extracting archives
- Reading archive contents
- Working with different archive formats and compression methods

You can use these C examples as a reference and adapt them to work with Swift by using Swift's interoperability with C.

## üõ†Ô∏è Building from Source

### Development Environment

This project uses [Nix](https://nixos.org/) as its primary package manager. There are two ways to enter the development environment:

1. **Manual Method**: Use the following command to enter the development shell:
   ```bash
   nix develop path:.
   ```

2. **Automatic Method (Preferred)**: Use [nix-direnv](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-direnv) which automatically loads the environment when you enter the project directory.

### Building the XCFramework

To build the libarchive.xcframework, you need:

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Xcode 16.3 or later installed on your system

2. **Build Process**:
   ```bash
   cd scripts
   make -j1
   ```

This will compile libarchive and all its dependencies for various Apple platforms and package them into a single XCFramework that can be used with Swift Package Manager.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

### Platform-Specific Limitations

This package includes custom patches to ensure compatibility across all Apple platforms. One significant patch (`scripts/patches/0002-libarchive-apple-support.patch`) addresses a fundamental limitation with iOS, watchOS, and tvOS:

**External Process Spawning Restriction**

The original libarchive code uses POSIX functions like `fork()`, `vfork()`, and `posix_spawn()` to create child processes for certain operations (such as when using external programs for compression/decompression). While this works fine on macOS, it presents a significant problem on iOS, watchOS, and tvOS because:

- These platforms have strict security sandboxing that prevents or severely restricts process spawning
- Attempting to use these functions could cause runtime crashes or unpredictable behavior

The patch detects when running on a non-macOS Apple platform and gracefully fails these operations rather than attempting to use functionality that would crash the app. This ensures that the library works reliably across all supported platforms, though with some functionality differences between macOS and other Apple platforms.
